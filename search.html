                <p>A collective bargaining agreement, often abbreviated as CBA, is a legally binding contract negotiated between a labor union and an employer. While CBAs do not encompass the full scope of graduate labor organizers' values and commitments, they do represent some important victories. When unions bargain with universities for new contracts, one important step is establishing precedence. By showing contract language won by other unions, organizers can demonstrate that the protections and benefits they seek are within the scope of the labor union's purview to bargain. This project gathers CBA from graduate unions across the United States to provide a resource for unions bargaining for increased justice-based protections for their members and their communities.</p>
                <p>As legal documents, CBAs typically have a structured format and may include several boilerplate elements, which are standardized clauses or sections that can be found across many agreements. These boilerplate elements have been omitted from the library below.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;" id="caveat">This database doesn't yet represent all CBAs across the US, but check back as more contracts are added!</p>
                <h3 style="text-align: center;">How to search the database</h3>
                <p>Each card below contains a section from a Collective Bargaining Agreement. Click on a card to see more about its contents. Each card also contains a link to the full CBA on the union's website.</p>
                <p>Click the magnifying glass icon in the upper right corner of the library to conduct a full-text keyword search. This will look for your search terms across all cards.</p>
                <p>Use the "Filter" tool in the top center of the library to only see certain results. For example, you can filter the cards to only see contract sections from public or private universities, or even from one specific university.</p>
