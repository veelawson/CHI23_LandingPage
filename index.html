                    <p>At public and private universities across the US, graduate students are leading the ongoing academic labor movement. Graduate unions fight for traditional protections—fair wages, workplace safety, and protections against harassment and discrimination—but they increasingly link their demands to a broader scope of safe working conditions.</p>    
                    <p>In solidarity with communities on and around their campuses, graduate unions are redefining the traditional purview of labor rights to include social justice concerns, connecting issues like Cops off Campus and #LandBack to the well-being and working conditions of graduate student workers and, thus, incorporating them into bargaining with universities. TITLE traces the rise of graduate labor unions and their shift towards activist, justice-focused organizing.

                <h4>The early years (1960s-1970s)</h4><p>
                    The struggle for graduate student worker rights can be traced back to the 1960s. Amidst a backdrop of civil rights activism, the anti-Vietnam War movement, and the feminist movement, graduate students began to organize in earnest, recognizing their shared labor struggles as teaching and research assistants. In 1969, the <a href="https://taa-madison.org/history/" target="_blank">University of Wisconsin-Madison Teaching Assistants Association (TAA)</a> became the first recognized graduate student union in the United States, three years after organizers recognized the need for a union while participating in an anti-draft sit-in. Here and at other universitites, early graduate unionization efforts focused on issues such as fair wages, benefits, and working conditions, with an explicit commitment to social justice and progressive politics. The following decades saw a surge of graduate student organizing efforts, with varying levels of success. In 1973, the <a href="https://www.geo3550.org/about/history/" target="_blank">University of Michigan Graduate Employees' Organization (GEO)</a> won recognition after a hard-fought strike. In the 1980s, the City University of New York (CUNY) established the <a href="https://psc-cuny.org/about-us/psc-history/" target="_blank">Professional Staff Congress (PSC)</a>, which included graduate student workers.
                </p>
                <h4>Legal obstacles (1980s-1990s)</h4><p>
                    However, it was not all smooth sailing for the graduate labor movement. In 1980, the Supreme Court ruled in <a href="https://www.lexisnexis.com/community/casebrief/p/casebrief-nlrb-v-yeshiva-univ" target="_blank">NLRB v. Yeshiva University</a> that full-time faculty members in private universities were managerial employees and thus ineligible for collective bargaining under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). This decision had a chilling effect on organizing efforts for years to come, as universities and the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) used the ruling to argue that graduate students were similarly ineligible for collective bargaining. Despite this, even as the broader labor movement experienced a decline in membership and influence through the 1980s and 1990s, graduate student unions maintained their commitments to activist organizing, in keeping with America's earlier labor traditions. 
                </p>
                <h4>Turning the tide (2000s-2010s)</h4><p>
                    After two decades of legal obstacles, the turn of the millennium brought renewed hope for graduate student unions. In 2000, the NLRB <a href="https://casetext.com/analysis/new-york-university-decision-summary-10" target="_blank">ruled in favor of graduate student workers at New York University (NYU)</a>, marking the first time that the Board recognized graduate students at a private institution as employees with the right to unionize under the NLRA. This victory was short-lived, however. In 2004, the NLRB reversed<a href="https://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/2004-05/04-004.html" target="_blank"> the NYU decision in the Brown University case</a>, once again denying private university graduate students the right to organize under the NLRA. Despite setbacks, the graduate student labor movement pressed on. In 2016, the NLRB overturned<a href="https://www.aaup.org/brief/columbia-university-364-nlrb-no-90-august-23-2016" target="_blank"> the Brown University decision in the Columbia University case</a>, restoring the rights of graduate students at private institutions to unionize. This landmark decision galvanized organizing efforts across the country, leading to union recognition at institutions such as <a href="https://harvardgradunion.org/" target="_blank">Harvard</a>, <a href="https://local33.org/" target="_blank">Yale</a>, and the <a href="https://uchicagogsu.org/" target="_blank">University of Chicago</a>.
                </p>
                <h4>Educate, agitate, organize (2020 and forward)</h4><p>
                    As political and economic turmoil has heated up in the late 2010s and early 2020s, graduate labor unions have increased pressures on universities to protect vulnerable student communities, divest from policing, and establish good relationships with Indigenous and racialized communities. Public university unions like the <a href="https://www.geo3550.org/" target="_blank">Graduate Employees' Organization at the University of Michigan</a> and <a href="https://uaw2865.org/" target="_blank">UAW 2865</a>, representing workers in the University of California system, have enacted <a href="https://forgeorganizing.org/article/abolitionist-strike" target="_blank">abolitionist strikes</a>, <a href="https://calmatters.org/education/higher-education/2022/12/uc-strike-civil-disobedience/" target="_blank">risked arrest</a>, and engaged in <a href="https://strikeuniversity.org/" target="_blank">teach-ins and public education</a> to build support for justice-focused organizing and to build labor power.
